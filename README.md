# Product CRUD frontend

This is CRUD application frontend built React JS

### To get Start

### Please note Node JS & Npm is installed and setup in your PC

Open your terminal and type

- git clone https://github.com/yash150411/product-crud-frontend.git

- cd product-crud-frontend

- npm i

Now as we have cloned the repository and installed the dependencies we need to export environment variable. So for that

### Create a .env file in your project root and then export envrinment variable

Environment variable to be exported are :-

- REACT_APP_API_URL=yourAPIUrlGoesHere

### Copy the environment given above in your .env file with your own credential.

For my backend repo product-crud-backend you can copy environment variable as

- REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3028/api

## So now as the environment variables are set you can run the start script for development environment

- npm run start

### This will start the React app on port 3000

## Yeah! Its done.
